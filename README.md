# Summary
Using a dataset that had different types of microbal species found in bellybuttons, I created an interactive website to view the data. I created a bar chart with the top 10 OTUs by the amount found. I also created a bubble chart that shows all of the OTUs and the amount found. The larger the circle on the graph the more numerous the OTU. I also created a gague chart that shows how frequently a person washed their bellybutton weekly from 0-9. 

By clicking on the drop down list on the left you can select what participant's data you would like to see. 

# Observations
It is unclear if there is a correlation between the amount of times a person washes their belly button and the amount and or type of microbal species found. This website serves as a visualization tool for each participants data. More work will be required to perform an analysis.
